#This code contains a combination of command code and SQL to extract the number pixel with forest, and of forest loss by yar, by watershed.
#Tested using Cygwin on Win7 x64, and with Postgres 9.3.5 and PostGIS 2.1.3

#Create database in shell/terminal
./createdb southeast -h127.0.0.1 -U postgres

#Enter the database from command line:

#Make the database a spatial database

#Import a shapefile (basins clipped to the Southeastern US by Mike - tiles of 40x80 and 40x90 from Forest Change dataset)

#Import raster of forest loss by year for the southeast (same tiles as listed above), for pixels where forest in 2000 was >=90%; this was obtained by multiplying the binary forest cover layer, above, by the original forest change layer

##The SQL Code needed to  calculate # of pixels of forest that was lost in each year, from 2001-2012, by watershed - Can be run through the Postgres Admnistrative tool, or through the command line, after entering the database via the previous command. Note, in SQL, # is NOT comment; to comment things out use the "--" before text
--This code works for just the southeast
